                <p>Part 1 (2012)</p>
<p>It rained again today.<br />
Sand's less white than beige<br />
and not quite fine<br />
but still I felt the quivering<br />
of the spaces between my fingers.<br />
I walked as slowly as memory-<br />
you and me once did<br />
on that rainy beach more beautiful than this.  </p>
<p>Now it's too quiet.<br />
Across this ocean pretending to be a lake<br />
another island where you are not<br />
unrolls along the horizon.<br />
Glassy gray reflects bright blue.<br />
Fellow travelers slice dark lines across the water<br />
that, like them, disappear.<br />
And what about these, my lines for you?  </p>
<p>What about the curve of you<br />
once right next to, once touching me?<br />
Just another skein of rain from sky to sea?<br />
What of our once-parallel trajectories,<br />
the sharing of presents and histories<br />
in effortless communion?<br />
The same saltwater may lap at all beaches<br />
but will our footsteps again follow the same shore?  </p>
<p>Here's another dispatch from where I am<br />
to where you are. When you open this,<br />
remember my lips against your forehead.<br />
Remember the nearness of my smile<br />
and the soft clarity of my voice beside your ear<br />
and know that I think of you always.<br />
Know that though my lines may sometimes bend<br />
they always - will always - reach for you.  </p>
<p>Part 2 (2013)</p>
<p>Here where they drive on the wrong side<br />
with their rented motorbikes<br />
I pedal myself to and fro.<br />
Here where we all walk like intruders,<br />
dress with fashionable disregard,<br />
and dance until moonset<br />
as if trying to close the gap<br />
between ourselves and ourselves.  </p>
<p>Here where the food is fresh and sweet and spicy.<br />
Here where the rain never lasts for long.<br />
Here where good cheer seems mandatory.<br />
Here where the parties last forever.<br />
Here where perception is easy to alter,<br />
memory easier to lose,<br />
and easiest of all to fall<br />
into the unbroken horizon.  </p>
<p>Here where like locusts in a frenzy<br />
they swarm and use themselves up<br />
leaving behind only silent husks,<br />
here where you touch each other briefly<br />
and without care,<br />
here where we are all far from where we should be.<br />
Here where none of this even matters;<br />
not until it's time to go back home.  </p>
<p>Here where barely anyone speaks my language<br />
I came to find my voice,<br />
but the quietness of the day defeats me<br />
so I sit and let the sound engulf me<br />
and a stillness hold me in place.<br />
Here where they come to lose themselves<br />
I came not to find myself, exactly,<br />
but just what holds everything together.  </p>
