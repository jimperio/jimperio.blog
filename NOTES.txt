1) Pelican 3.1.1 is the latest package, but it does not yet include support for the override attributes 'url' and 'save_as', so just install the latest from source [1] for now.

This fork of Pelican also fixes an issue with relative URLs on Windows. (pull request pending)

2) There's a weird issue with locale.getlocale() on OS X, and having an invalid encoding returned causes some issues with Pelican. A quick fix is to just set the LANG environment variable to, say, "en_US.UTF-8".

3) The ghp-import package doesn't install well on Windows, as it uses a directly-executable script. The fork at [2] modifies the setup to generate console scripts instead.
