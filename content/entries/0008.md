Title: Housekeeping
Date: 2015-05-13

It's again been too long since I've updated here, but late is better than never! 

I've recently been more consciously working on my software development skills and portfolio (probably the subject of another entry entirely), so I revisited this blog and cleaned up and updated the backend a little.

Let's see how I've fared on the goals in [my last post](|filename|0007.md)!

* Learning to drive - No progress. License is still expired and missing, and I still need to get more informal practice before applying for a license (and taking the exam) again.
* Side projects - I haven't started any new ones, and I've more or less gotten bored with the Phaser game. I might pick that up again, but I'm now leaning towards starting a project in Python instead!
* Learning a new programming language - Haskell has been fun and I'm continuing to work on exercises, putting up my answers [here](https://github.com/jimperio/haskell-exercises). I'm also considering starting a small project in C.
* Learning to swim - Sadly, we've moved out of White Plains and no longer have easy access to a swimming pool.
* Write and blog regularly - heh.

It pays to keep in mind: just keep moving forward!
