Title: Hello (again), world
Date: 2015-01-28

I am severely out of blogging shape, but the first step is always the hardest.

Hello, 2015, let's kick ass! It's time to finally do the things I've wanted to do for so long:

* Learn to drive
* Work on side-projects (a toy project using Phaser is up at GitHub: [game](http://jimperio.github.io/speedy-spin), [source](https://github.com/jimperio/speedy-spin))
* Learn a new (programming) language (giving [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) another try)
* Learn to swim
* Write and blog regularly

I need to remember: it's just about continuing to move forward, bit by bit, every day!
