Title: Setting up a workflow

Slowly getting this blog up to speed. As mentioned previously, I'm currently hosting this website on <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, and I've no real complaints so far. Setup has been mostly painless and easy.

I moved from a User page to a Project page, which has the benefit of allowing me to keep both the source and the actual static website output in the <a href="http://github.com/jimperio/jimperio.blog">same repo</a>, only on different branches. <a href="https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import">ghp-import</a> is very useful and makes managing the gh-pages branch almost brainless.

Hopefully by next week I'll be able to focus more on writing new entries. Although I have to admit that this setup stuff is fun, too! I haven't used git much (at all) on previous projects, and it still feels a bit strange to me, being more used to hg.
