    <p>You know you're a rusty blogger when the old doubts regain their power to reduce you to feeling like a worthless, self-indulgent git with nothing to say and no right to erect and stand on yet another tiny cyberspace platform. I know that it's already (mostly) socially-acceptable for anyone to start a blog and just begin running off at the fingers, and yet, don't we all aspire to actually live up to our above-average perception of ourselves?</p>
<p>And all that is perhaps just a very long-winded (and, yes, self-indulgent) way of saying that in this essay I simply aim to justify blogging to myself. Let's begin with the easy, obvious reasons.</p>
<p>*</p>
<h1>A software developer should really have a website.</h1>
<p>Even just a bare-bones one such as this. I can't believe I haven't gotten around to doing this until just now. It's fun as a little side project, especially since I'm not currently doing web development. I'll get to mess around with and learn about a different set of tools for a different problem domain.</p>
<h1>It's a great way to get oneself to write, and to hone those writing skills.</h1>
<p>Well, obviously. I suppose the term "blogging" could be stretched to cover certain cases that involve little to no actual writing at all, but those cases aren't what I want to do or talk about here!</p>
<p>Starting a blog more or less also means committing to updating that blog with content regularly. I recently again came across Ira Glass' wonderful articulation of the need to just keep producing work, if you're really serious about getting better at what you do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What nobody tells people who are beginners — and I really wish someone had told this to me . . . is that all of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, and it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not.</p>
<p>But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase. They quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it’s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story.</p>
<p>It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every writer has at some point had the sinking experience of reading someone else's work and thinking, that's it, there's no hope for me, there's no way I'll ever write anything nearly as good! Here, Glass reassures us: that experience is universal, and it can eventually be overcome, if you just put in the effort, pay your dues, and do your work. The quality of your work will eventually catch up to your taste. It seems so perfectly obvious, but if it were, then why do a lot of creatives still seem to have trouble accepting it?</p>
<p>Personally, I know I still have a long way to go. And keeping a blog will help me force myself to just keep writing. Having my writing accessible online to the whole world will hopefully also help to rein in any indulgent tendencies and to keep me disciplined about always producing effective, interesting writing.</p>
<h1>Writing things out aids in processing and understanding them.</h1>
<p>In attempting to explain or express something to someone else, one of course has to do it to oneself first. And one can't write about anything without having to clarify it in one's mind first, think about it in an orderly way, and fit it into the rest of one's current overall mental model. To teach anything, one has to learn and understand it first. So I should expect that if I can just be disciplined about what I write, I will end up learning a lot and improving my understanding significantly.</p>
<p>I tried to start an "idea blog" before, where I was going to write about all the interesting things I end up reading and learning and studying about, but it sadly never really got off the ground. The concept is sound, I think, I just need to actually do it and write!</p>
<p>On a more personal note, I'm one of those people who process life events rather slowly, and often it's only after I actively think about things by writing them out that I feel like I've actually thought about them properly. I've learned to recognize how journalling and attempting to express my thoughts help to stave off that numb feeling of just being mutely swept along.</p>
<h1>Lastly, who knows, maybe you, dear reader, might also get something from all this!</h1>
<p>I put this at the very last because, truthfully, I don't really expect any significant readership. But still, with previous blogs, I did experience some few moments of connection with readers, and I'd feel really lucky if this blog enables those to happen again. It was extremely satisfying to know that what I wrote and put out there can actually have an effect on others. (I'm still inordinately proud of having convinced a stranger on the Internet who just happened upon my blog of the charms of Haruki Murakami...)</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Am I convinced? Well, let's just say that I'm getting there. The process of conceiving and writing this essay did help exactly as I described above, and I'm growing more excited about writing more in the future.</p>
<p>Let the positive feedback loop slowly begin!</p>
