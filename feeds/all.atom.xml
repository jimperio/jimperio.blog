As mentioned previously, I'm currently hosting this website on &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, and I've no real complaints so far. Setup has been mostly painless and easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved from a User page to a Project page, which has the benefit of allowing me to keep both the source and the actual static website output in the &lt;a href="http://github.com/jimperio/jimperio.blog"&gt;same repo&lt;/a&gt;, only on different branches. &lt;a href="https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import"&gt;ghp-import&lt;/a&gt; is very useful and makes managing the gh-pages branch almost brainless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by next week I'll be able to focus more on writing new entries. Although I have to admit that this setup stuff is fun, too! I haven't used git much (at all) on previous projects, and it still feels a bit strange to me, being more used to hg. I'm also pretty new to Markdown, and I haven't really touched HTML/CSS in a long time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm just glad it was this easy to get a(n admittedly simple, static) website up and running. Now, to optimize the writing, updating, and deployment workflow!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>It's alive!</title><link href="http://jimperio.com/its-alive.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-11T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Jomel Imperio</name></author><id>tag:jimperio.com,2013-04-11:its-alive.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, that wasn't so hard. Pulled the trigger today on this jimperio.com domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently using &lt;a href="http://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, and hosting the static output on &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. The source for this blog is also on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jimperio/jimperio.blog"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see what we can make of this. Quite obviously, this website is still under construction: expect more content (and even more tweaking) in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
