I've previously read and thoroughly enjoyed his &lt;em&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;, and I have to say that he writes refreshingly intellectual pageturners, which seems to me a fairly rare class. (Of course, I'd be really glad to be proved otherwise!) I mean, one wouldn't generally expect something like the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to be an important theme in a pageturner, or for the main character to be an academic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that attracted and held me to &lt;em&gt;Anathem's&lt;/em&gt; world is the concept and depiction of the Mathic culture and society. In brief, it's a manifestation of the proverbial ivory tower. Members of this society, called avout, swear a vow to withdraw from the outside world and devote themselves to learning and the pursuit of knowledge. Their retreats (called maths) are essentially secular monasteries -- they don't abide by any particular religion, and most are in fact areligious. Maths are generally self-sufficient and self-contained, and the avout are provided rigorous intellectual training before being set free to pursue their interests, no matter how arcane or esoteric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all sounds so much like a place I would love to be able to call home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I do realize that the whole thing is a big idealization. In the real world, entering the academe comes with its own particular set of practical difficulties. Still, for me it does express quite well the appeal of the academe: the freedom to learn for learning's sake, the heavy-if-not-exclusive dealing in intellectual abstractions and generalities, the thrill of doing research and discovering new things about the world or useful new ways of looking at the world, and the feeling of becoming part of a great tradition. There are the impassioned debates and disciplined conversations one can have with fellow academics. There is that purity and elegance of theory over practice that I still can't quite verbalize even though it's what supposedly made my naive pre-college self choose "pure" physics over applied physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say whether I'll ever go back to university, but it probably will always remain in that "someday maybe" compartment in the back of my mind. In the meantime, I'll feed the urge with novels like &lt;em&gt;Anathem&lt;/em&gt; and my little hobbyist forays into writing, philosophy, history, and literature, which I really do need to make more time and find more energy for...&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Setting up a workflow</title><link href="http://jimperio.com/setting-up-a-workflow.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-12T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Jomel Imperio</name></author><id>tag:jimperio.com,2013-04-12:setting-up-a-workflow.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Slowly getting this blog up to speed. As mentioned previously, I'm currently hosting this website on &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, and I've no real complaints so far. Setup has been mostly painless and easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved from a User page to a Project page, which has the benefit of allowing me to keep both the source and the actual static website output in the &lt;a href="http://github.com/jimperio/jimperio.blog"&gt;same repo&lt;/a&gt;, only on different branches. &lt;a href="https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import"&gt;ghp-import&lt;/a&gt; is very useful and makes managing the gh-pages branch almost brainless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by next week I'll be able to focus more on writing new entries. Although I have to admit that this setup stuff is fun, too! I haven't used git much (at all) on previous projects, and it still feels a bit strange to me, being more used to hg. I'm also pretty new to Markdown, and I haven't really touched HTML/CSS in a long time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm just glad it was this easy to get a(n admittedly simple, static) website up and running. Now, to optimize the writing, updating, and deployment workflow!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>It's alive!</title><link href="http://jimperio.com/its-alive.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-11T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Jomel Imperio</name></author><id>tag:jimperio.com,2013-04-11:its-alive.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, that wasn't so hard. Pulled the trigger today on this jimperio.com domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently using &lt;a href="http://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, and hosting the static output on &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. The source for this blog is also on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jimperio/jimperio.blog"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see what we can make of this. Quite obviously, this website is still under construction: expect more content (and even more tweaking) in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
